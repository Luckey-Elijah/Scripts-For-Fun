# Scripts for Fun

Essentially, right now these are for fresh installs, task management, and other tools for different OSes that I use. Now, they are are essentially just packages installers but plan on implementing other useful functions.

Dependant on these free tools: 

  - [Apt](https://packages.ubuntu.com/)
  - [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
  - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
